# Experimental Results for Soil Moisture Sensing
Our experiment investigates the relationship between key agricultural soil parametersâ€”specifically soil moisture, Time of Flight (ToF), and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). To conduct this study, we collected soil samples representative of typical agricultural conditions. Due to their initial humidity levels, these samples were subjected to a two-day drying process under sunlight to achieve a stable baseline for evaluation. Soil moisture content is expressed as Volumetric Water Content (VWC), a crucial metric for assessing the amount of water retained within the soil matrix. Understanding these relationships helps in optimizing irrigation strategies and improving agricultural efficiency.
